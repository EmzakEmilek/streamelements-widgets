DONATION & SUBGOAL BAR – COMMERCIALIZATION SUMMARY (v0.9.3-pre)
Generated: 2025-09-28

============================================================
1. UNIQUE VALUE / USP
------------------------------------------------------------
Multi-level (up to 10) cascading donation goals with non-reset percent logic, subscriber milestone formatting, dual confetti groups (micro vs goal), unified glow engine w/ intensity mapping, ambient idle shine, Smart Auto Contrast (adaptive readability), performance safeguards (throttle + caps + duplicate tip filtering), and bilingual documentation (EN/SK). Stable event handling and temporary progress bar color sync create polished feedback loops.

Short pitch:
“Advanced multi-level donation & subgoal bar with intelligent contrast, dual celebration FX, ambient motion, and performance-safe design.”

============================================================
2. COMPETITOR LANDSCAPE (QUALITATIVE)
------------------------------------------------------------
Baseline SE Goal Widget: single goal, minimal animation, no milestone formatting.
Generic Community Scripts: often lack performance throttling, multi-level support, or autocontrast.
Overlay Pack Marketplaces (OWN3D, NerdOrDie): focus on visual theme bundles; multi-level logic rare.
Your edge: structured multi-level progression + robust code quality + localized docs.

============================================================
3. DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL SCORING
------------------------------------------------------------
Scale 1 (poor) – 5 (strong). Criteria: audience fit, control, friction, revenue share, authenticity.

PRIMARY (initial focus):
- Discord (Onyxx + own) .......... 4.8  (direct feedback, zero fees)
- Gumroad / Lemon Squeezy ........ 4.3  (fast launch, tax handling, coupons)
- Twitch panel + chatbot command ..4.3  (in-stream conversion, authenticity)
- Ko-fi Shop ...................... 3.5  (casual supporter appeal)
- OWN3D / NerdOrDie marketplace ... 3.9  (reach vs control tradeoff)
- Twitter/X teasers / short clips . 3.8  (awareness funnel)
- Itch.io (tools) ................. 3.2  (secondary audience)

ADDITIONAL (as requested):
- Fiverr .......................... 2.5  (Gig model favors custom commissions, less scalable for productized widget; risk of scope creep)
- Upwork .......................... 2.2  (Primarily contract sourcing; per-project bureaucracy; low product discoverability)
- Etsy ............................ 2.0  (Buyer intent is physical/digital art assets; streaming utilities niche; algorithm mismatch)

LOW PRIORITY (hold): Patreon (3.0), GitHub Sponsors (2.2).

Recommended launch bundle: Discord + Gumroad + Twitch panel. Expand once stable testimonials exist.

============================================================

============================================================
5. TONE & BRANDING STRATEGY
------------------------------------------------------------

Avoid over-corporate claims; emphasize stability, performance, and multi-level clarity.
Docs stay precise; Discord announcements concise bullet style; marketing copy uses real overlay screenshots/GIFs.

Message pillars:
- Performance-safe

- Celebration without spam
- Localization & accessibility

============================================================
6. ONYXX CLOSED BETA PLAN

Onboarding Pack: ZIP (versioned), README, feedback template.
Feedback Template: version, description, expected vs actual, repro steps, severity, media.
Cadence: weekly digest + Kanban triage (To triage / In progress / Fixed / Deferred).
Incentives: Lifetime 50% coupon + mention + possible preset showcase.
Milestones: Beta1 (stability) → Beta2 (UX refine) → RC (zero critical) → 1.0.0 launch.
Exit criterion: 2 weeks no critical bug post-RC.

============================================================
7. OPERATIONS & DELIVERY STACK
------------------------------------------------------------
Sales Platform: Lemon Squeezy (EU VAT) or Gumroad (speed). ZIP packaging.
Versioning: tag per widget (donation-subgoal-bar@0.9.3-pre → 0.9.4 → 1.0.0).
Changelog style: [Added] [Improved] [Fixed] [Perf] [Docs].
Support: Central Discord threads (48h SLA personal, 24h commercial optional).
Refund policy: 7 days for non-functionality / unresolved critical issues.

Future SaaS option: Cloud presets sync (subscription upsell).

============================================================
8. RISK & MITIGATION MATRIX
------------------------------------------------------------
Piracy ............ Rapid update cadence + community value (support) + optional Lite watermark.
Support overload .. Triage template + consolidated channels + priority flags.
Scope creep ....... Roadmap scoring (Impact / Effort / Alignment) & monthly freeze.
Burnout ........... Batch releases, not continuous patch drip.
Marketplace cut ... Use as secondary reach, push primary sales to own channel.
Low adoption ...... Beta testimonials + GIF demos + clear USP bullets.
Feature parity loss Competitors copying: differentiate via polish, performance metrics, documentation excellence.

============================================================

============================================================
10. NEXT STEP RECOMMENDATIONS (IMMEDIATE)
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Spin up Discord beta structure + role today.
2. Package current build as Beta1 ZIP.
3. Draft listing (do not publish) – insert USP bullets + placeholder media.
4. Generate coupon & store internally.
5. Start recruiting 10 Onyxx testers (DM short pitch + expectations).
6. After first week: synthesize feedback → prioritize 3 fixes max.
7. Begin preparing GIF media concurrently.

============================================================
11. EXTENDED CHANNEL NOTES (FIVERR / UPWORK / ETSY)
------------------------------------------------------------
Fiverr: Good for custom one-off gigs; less ideal for passive product; leads expect personalization → time drain.
Upwork: Strong for contract development; discovery for a fixed-price overlay widget is low; overhead in proposals.
Etsy: Marketplace algorithm favors visual art / printable / crafting; streaming utility search volume modest; risk of low conversion.
Conclusion: Treat them as inbound-only (if at all), not proactive launch pillars.

============================================================
12. METRICS TO TRACK (ONCE LIVE)
------------------------------------------------------------
Adoption: # sales per week, conversion % from listing views.
Support Load: tickets/week, avg first response time.
Churn Risk (if subscription later): cancellation reasons category counts.
Performance: average confetti count tests (manual), reported FPS drops.
Feature Requests: categorize (FX, UX, Perf, Integration) frequency.

============================================================
